    "We provide three sets of resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are primarily interested in applying SuSiE to your own data in a generic setting, please see the [susieR package](https://stephenslab.github.io/susieR). A good place to start is the [vignettes page](https://stephenslab.github.io/susieR/articles/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you would like to reproduce the numerical studies in comparison with fine-mapping methods CAVIAR, FINEMAP and DAP, please see [here](DSC.html) for an implementation in the Dynamic Statistical Comparison framework, and [here](numerical_results.html) to reproduce figures and tables in the numerical studies section of the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you would like to use SuSiE for fine-mapping of molecular traits similar to our data application of association analysis of splice QTL data please see [here](Li_2016_sQTL.html) for details -- we provide a pipeline for fine-mapping with SuSiE and enrichment analysis with GREGOR."
