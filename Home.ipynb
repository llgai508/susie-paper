    "\n",
    "1. If you are primarily interested in applying SuSiE to your own data in a generic setting, please see the [susieR package](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you would like to reproduce the numerical studies in comparison with fine mapping methods CAVIAR, FINEMAP and DAP, please see [here]() for an implementation in the Dynamic Statistical Comparison framework, and [here]() to reproduce figures in the numerical studies section of the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you would like to use SuSiE for fine-mapping of molecular traits similar to our data application of association analysis of splice QTL data please follow the instructions [here]() -- we provide a pipeline for fine-mapping with SuSiE and enrichment analysis with GREGOR. "
